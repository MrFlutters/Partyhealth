# TES3MP-Partyhealth-Add-on

REQUIRES: [helpHelper](https://github.com/Nkfree/helpHelper)!

## What it does:
When ```Player1``` 'Activates' ```Player2``` he gets continuous update of ```Player2```'s health as GUI or CHAT message.

## How to INSTALL:
1. Download the ```main.lua``` and put it in */server/scripts/custom/Partyhealth*
2. Open ```customScripts.lua``` and add this code on separate line: ```Partyhealth = require "custom/Partyhealth/main"```


## How to do it in-game (if it needs further explanation):

Approach another ```Player``` and hit the button which you use for opening ```doors```.

For list of commands type in the chat: /ph.help
